        <p><h1>Boards</h1></p>
            <p><h2>Arduino UNO Rev3</h2></p>
            <p>The Arduino UNO Rev.3 board is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (data sheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.</p>

            <p><h2>Arduino Mega2560 Rev3</h2></p>
            <p>The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Mega is compatible with most shields designed for the Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila.</p>

            <p><h2>Arduino Nano mini</h2></p>
            <p>The Nano is a particularly small Arduino specially developed for working with plugboards. It fits almost all common plug systems, with pins fed downwards via pin strips and a practical size. This makes it even easier to try out new ideas and projects.</p>

        <p><h1>Modules</h1></p>
            <p><h2>Bluetooth Module HC-06</h2></p>
            <p>Allows your device to both send or receive the TTL data via Bluetooth technology without connecting a serial cable to your computer. Works with any USB Bluetooth adapters. Default Baud Rate: 9600,8,1,n.</p>

            <p><h2>Black / White Track Line Follower Sensor 3pin</h2></p>
            <p>Black / White Line Follower Sensor is an add-on for, a must have add-on, for any project with line tracking. It gives your robot the ability to detect lines, or nearby objects. The sensor works by detecting reflected light coming from its own infrared LED. By measuring the amount of reflected infrared light, it can detect transitions from light to dark (lines) or even objects directly in front of it. The mounting hole lets you easily connect one or more of these to the front or back of your robot chassis.</p>

            <p><h2>DT-06 Wireless WiFi Serial Port</h2></p>
            <p>TTL-WiFi is designed and developed based on ESP-M2 WiFi module which is extracted the TTL, EN, STATE and other pins. The TTL-WiFi is already built-in the serial transparent transmission firmware , which can realize the transparent transmit the data to the cloud on the real-time, together with low-power control, status indicator. This board can replace the old wiring serial WiFi device to realize the data collection and control.</p>
